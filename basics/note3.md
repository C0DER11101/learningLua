# Functions

* In Lua, functions are first-class values, meaning that:
	* they can be stored in variables.
	* they can be passed as arguments to other functions.
	* they can be returned as results.
* Lua offers good support for functional programming.
* Lua can call functions written in Lua and also **functions written in C**.
